# WarehouseWreckage
 My first project from tutorials. It demonstrates the understanding of Blueprint basics, Programming basics, Unreal basics, and Object Oriented basics. Created a warehouse and in the warehouse are objects and you can shoot the object with a cannonball knocking them over. <br/>
 * I added my own spin to the project: 
   * things like cannoball explosion from get actors location added with the forward vector. 
   * I added a reload button.
